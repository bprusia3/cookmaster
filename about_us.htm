    <p>Cookmaster is a website that is designed for people to go on and find a simple easy recipie or a intresting one thats not so serious. this website was made because a man named Benjamin prusia wanted to put somthing out on the internet to help people cook. The reason why its called cook "master" is because with enough practice anybody can be a master at cooking. this is what Benjamin wanted to inspire into this website. Cookmaster is a simple website for people to come across and feel like a master when they cook since the recipies are not hard to make.</p>
